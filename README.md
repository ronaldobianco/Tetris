# Tetris in Python

This project is an implementation of the famous game Tetris using the Python programming language and the Pygame library.

## Features

- The Tetris game is fully playable, with all the rules and mechanics characteristic of the original game.
- The player can move the pieces left or right, rotate them, and accelerate their descent.
- The pieces fall automatically, and the player must fit them together to complete horizontal lines.
- When a line is completed, it disappears, and the player earns points.
- The game ends when the pieces stack up to the top of the screen.
